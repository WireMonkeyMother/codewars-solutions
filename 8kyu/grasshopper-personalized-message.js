// Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

// Use conditionals to return the proper message:

// case	                return
// name equals owner	'Hello boss'
// otherwise            'Hello guest'

//MY SOLUTION:---
const greet = (name, owner) => name == owner? 'Hello boss': 'Hello guest'

//ADDITIONAL NOTES: I was very happy with this solution, as I got both the arrow notation and the ternary without challenge.
