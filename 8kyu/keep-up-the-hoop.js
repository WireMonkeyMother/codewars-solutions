// Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

// Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

// If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
// If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

//MY SOLUTION:

const hoopCount = n => n>=10?'Great, now move on to tricks':'Keep at it until you get it'

//ADDITIONAL NOTES: It's been a while since I've done these super easy ones, so it's nice to see how my skills have improved. I didn't even have to think twice about how to solve this one with proper syntax, which was a bit of a struggle for me just a month or two ago.
