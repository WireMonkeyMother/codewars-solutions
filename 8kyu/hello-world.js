// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

//MY SOLUTION ---

const greet = () => 'hello world!'

//ADDITIONAL NOTES: For myself, I was most happy to show my friends that I was getting practice with arrow functions, so I went with that. However, in looking through the other responses, I found someone who had made a very clever function that I really enjoyed, and watned to preserve that here as well

// const OPENING = `Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse,
// and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
// It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the

// knocking people's hats off - then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol
// and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.`;
