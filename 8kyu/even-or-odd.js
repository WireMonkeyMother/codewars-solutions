// Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

//MY SOLUTION ---

const even_or_odd = number => number % 2 == 0 ? 'Even' : 'Odd';

//ADDITIONAL NOTES: Although this wasn't a hard problem, it was my first time successfully writing the answer as both an arrow function and using a ternary operator. I'm going to try using this form more frequently, because I have a hard time visualizing it like I do with the longer forms.
