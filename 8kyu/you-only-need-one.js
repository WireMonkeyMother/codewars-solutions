// You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

// Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

// Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

//MY SOLUTION:---

const check = (a,x) => a.includes(x)

//ADDITIONAL NOTES: Again, nothing fancy, just practice with arrow notation and knowning which method to use.
